### Hi there 👋

I'm a computer engineer from Uruguay. I'm always learning new stuff, hacking away on useless open source projects of my own, and occasionally contributing to useful projects made by other people.

### 🐱‍💻 Currently hacking on

- [gotorrent](https://github.com/ismaelpadilla/gotorrent), a TUI for searching torrents implemented in Go.
- I'm always looking to collaborate on cool stuff. Hit me up!

### About me

- 🏢 I'm a Tech Lead at Scanntech.
- 💻 [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is my editor of choice while not using Java.
- ❤ In love with Go and Rust.
- 🐧 I use Linux (Manjaro) with [i3](https://i3wm.org/).
- 💪🏻 I'm active on StackOverflow, where I'm one of the top 10% answerers in React, JavaScript, and Python.
